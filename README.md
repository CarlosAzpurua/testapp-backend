# Test App Backend

This project is the backend portion of a challenge developed to test various tools and skills, including practical use of Node.js (developed in Node 14), JavaScript (ES6+), Express, Mocha, and Chai. 

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installation üîß

To start all processes, functionalities, and tests, we will need to install some libraries beforehand. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```
npm i
```

Alternatively, you can run:

```
npm install
```

This will install the libraries specified in the `package.json` file, which are described in more detail below.

## Deployment üì¶‚öôÔ∏è

To start the app, run the following code in the terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
npm start
```

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook.
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - A JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser.
- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - A utility that automatically restarts your node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file.
- [express](https://expressjs.com/) - A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/) - A JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras.
- [lodash-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-es) - A modern, modular JavaScript utility library.

Note: The above libraries were used for their respective functionalities, which are explained in detail below.

### Chai

Chai is a BDD/TDD assertion library for Node.js and the browser that allows us to write clear and expressive assertions for our tests.

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. It provides an easy-to-use interface for writing and running tests, as well as a powerful set of features for mocking, code coverage analysis, and more.

### Mocha

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It provides a wide range of testing features, such as asynchronous testing, test coverage, and easy-to-use reporting.

### Nodemon

Nodemon is a utility that automatically restarts your node application when file changes in the directory are detected. This helps to speed up the development process by automatically refreshing the server whenever changes are made.

### Axios

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It provides an easy-to-use interface for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

### Dotenv

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file. This helps to keep sensitive information secure and hidden from public view.

### Express

Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware, and error handling.

### Lodash

Lodash is a JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance & extras. It provides a set of reusable functions that help to simplify and
